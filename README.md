# jlisp

My own lisp that i built, based on Daniel Holdens "Build your own lisp"

~I built this partially to learn some more old-fashion C, but also to really understand what a lisp is.~

I rewrote this project in rust because ofc.

I also built all of this on my IBM Thinkpad T34 with the goal of using it for this years AdventOfCode.

## Features i still want to add:

- Better error messages
- remove unnecessary copy/clones
